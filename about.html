          The dark web is a part of the internet that isn't indexed by search
          engines. You've no doubt heard talk of the “dark web” as a hotbed of
          criminal activity — and it is. Researchers Daniel Moore and Thomas Rid
          of King's College in London classified the contents of 2,723 live dark
          web sites over a five-week period in 2015 and found that 57% host
          illicit material. A 2019 study, Into the Web of Profit, conducted by
          Dr. Michael McGuires at the University of Surrey, shows that things
          have become worse. The number of dark web listings that could harm an
          enterprise has risen by 20% since 2016. Of all listings (excluding
          those selling drugs), 60% could potentially harm enterprises. [ Learn

          numbers, all manner of drugs, guns, counterfeit money, stolen
          subscription credentials, hacked Netflix accounts and software that
          helps you break into other people’s computers. Buy login credentials
          to a $50,000 Bank of America account, counterfeit $20 bills, prepaid
          debit cards, or a “lifetime” Netflix premium account. You can hire
          hackers to attack computers for you. You can buy usernames and
          passwords. Not everything is illegal, the dark web also has a
          legitimate side. For example, you can join a chess club or BlackBook,
          a social network described as the “the Facebook of Tor.” Note: This
          post contains links to dark web sites that can only be accessed with
          the Tor browser, which can be downloaded for free at
          https://www.torproject.org.
